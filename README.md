# 1.	Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI. 

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can create certain types of images, text, videos, and other media by responding to prompts.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that generates images, text, videos, and other media in response to inputted prompts.

AI generators like ChatGPT and DALL-E2 are gaining worldwide popularity. These programs respond to user prompts. Submit a text prompt, and the generator will produce an output, whether a story or outline from ChatGPT or a monkey painted in a Victorian style by DALL-E2.


# What is generative AI?
Generative AI, also called GenAI, allows users to input a variety of prompts to generate new content, such as text, images, videos, sounds, code, 3D designs, and other media. It “learns” and trains on documents and artefacts that already exist online.

Generative AI evolves as it continues to train on more data. It operates on AI models and algorithms trained on large unlabeled data sets, requiring complex maths and lots of computing power. These data sets train the AI to predict outcomes in the same ways humans might act or develop independently.

The rise of generative AI is mainly because people can now use natural language to prompt AI, so its use cases have multiplied. Across different industries, AI generators are now used as companions for writing, research, coding, designing, and more.

# How does generative AI work?
Generative AI models use neural networks to identify patterns in existing data to generate new content. Trained on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches, organisations can create foundation models from large, unlabeled data sets, forming a base for AI systems to perform tasks.

Some examples of foundation models include LLMs, GANs, VAEs, and Multimodal, which power tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and more. ChatGPT draws data from GPT-3 and enables users to generate a story based on a prompt. Another foundation model, Stable Diffusion, allows users to create realistic images based on text input.

# Popular AI generators

# 4. Explain about LLM and how it is build.

# What are LLMs?


Large language models (LLMs) are a category of deep learning models trained on immense amounts of data, making them capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks. LLMs are built on a type of neural network architecture called a transformer which excels at handling sequences of words and capturing patterns in text.

LLMs work as giant statistical prediction machines that repeatedly predict the next word in a sequence. They learn patterns in their text and generate language that follows those patterns.

LLMs represent a major leap in how humans interact with technology because they are the first AI system that can handle unstructured human language at scale, allowing for natural communication with machines. Where traditional search engines and and other programmed systems used algorithms to match keywords, LLMs capture deeper context, nuance and reasoning. LLMs, once trained, can adapt to many applications that involve interpreting text, like summarizing an article, debugging code or drafting a legal clause. When given agentic capabilities, LLMs can perform, with varying degrees of autonomy, various tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans.

LLMs are the culmination of decades of progress in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning research, and their development is largely responsible for the explosion of artificial intelligence advancements across the late 2010s and 2020s. Popular LLMs have become household names, bringing generative AI to the forefront of the public interest. LLMs are also used widely in enterprises, with organizations investing heavily across numerous business functions and use cases.

LLMs are easily accessible to the public through interfaces like Anthropic’s Claude, Open AI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, Meta’s Llama models, and Google’s Gemini assistant, along with its BERT and PaLM models. IBM maintains a Granite model series on watsonx.ai, which has become the generative AI backbone for other IBM products like watsonx Assistant and watsonx Orchestrate. 

# Using large language models

Once trained, large language models work by responding to prompts by tokenizing the prompt, converting it into embeddings, and using its transformer to generate text one token at a time, calculating the probabilities for all potential next tokens, and outputting the most likely one. This process, called inference, is repeated until the output is complete. The model does not “know” the final answer in advance; it uses all the statistical relationships it learned in training to predict one token at a time, making its best guess at every step.

The easiest and fastest way to get domain-specific knowledge from a general-purpose LLM is through prompt engineering, which does not require additional training. Users can modify prompts in all sorts of ways. For example, a prompt like “answer in the voice of a trained healthcare professional” could yield more relevant results (Note that LLMs are not recommended to be used for medical advice!).

LLMs have other strategies to control their outputs, such as LLM temperature, which controls the randomness of text that is generated by LLMs during inference, or top-k/top-p sampling, which limits the set of tokens considered to the most likely ones, balancing creativity and coherence.

The context window is the maximum number of tokens that a model can “see” and use at once when generating text. Early LLMs had short windows, but newer LLMs have hundreds of thousands of tokens in their context windows, enabling use cases like summarizing entire research papers, performing code assistance on large codebases and holding long continuous conversations with users.

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a method for connecting a pretrained model with external knowledge bases, enabling them to deliver more relevant responses at a higher level of accuracy. The retrieved information is passed into the model’s context window, so the model can use it when generating responses, without needing retraining. For example, by connecting an LLM to a dynamic weather service database, an LLM can retrieve information for a user about that day’s weather report.

 Large language model use cases 
LLMs are redefining business processes and have proven their versatility across a myriad of use cases in many industries.

 Text generation:

LLMs can do all sorts of content creation tasks like drafting emails, blog posts or legal memos in response to prompts.

 Text summarization: 

LLMs can summarize long articles, news stories, research reports, corporate documentation and customer history into thorough texts tailored in length to a desired output format and style.

AI assistants:

Chatbots powered by conversational AI can perform question answering and provide detailed information as a part of an integrated, real-time customer care solution. 

Code generation:

Code assist platforms aid developers in building applications, finding errors in code and uncovering security issues in multiple programming languages, even translating between them.

Sentiment analysis: 

Customer tone is analyzed in order to better understand customer feedback at scale. 

Language translation:
